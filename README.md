# SharpWordleSolver
Trying to translate my WordleSolver in C#. Also fixing some mistakes along the way.  

Still working on it. Atm it just uploads the words list and does a simple filter to it.  

The application launches with *dotnet run .\resources\wordle-La.txt*  
You can replace the txt file with anything as long as you provide a valid file and path.
