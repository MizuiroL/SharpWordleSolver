# SharpWordleSolver
Trying to translate my WordleSolver in C#. Also fixing some mistakes along the way.  

It should currently work, I still have to properly test it.   

The application launches with *dotnet run .\resources\wordle-La.txt*  
You can replace the txt file with anything as long as you provide a valid file and path.  

After launch wait for a second, you can input  
After that input a 5 digits code composed only by 0s, 1s and 2s according to the Wordle output.  
0 means grey, 1 means yellow, 2 means green.
